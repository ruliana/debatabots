Functional Programming is better than OOP for code reuse.

## Turn 2
Socratic Philosopher:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "better"?

## Turn 3
Functional Programming Evangelist:

 Sure, here are some criteria I will use to compare the two paradigms when it comes to code reuse:
 1. Immutability
 2. Purity
 3. Higher-Order Functions
 4. Composition
 5. Separation of Concerns
 6. Modularity
 Let's go through each of these points in turn and compare how functional programming is better suited for code reuse than OOP.
 

## Turn 4
Socratic Philosopher:
Great, let's start with the first criterion: immutability. Can you explain how immutability is related to code reuse and how functional programming is better suited for it compared to OOP?

## Turn 5
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Sure thing!

Immutability refers to the concept of not modifying data once it has been created. This is important for code reuse because it makes it easier to reason about the behavior of a function or component. With immutable data, you can be sure that the function or component will always behave the same way when given the same input.

Functional programming is better suited to immutability than OOP is because immutability is baked into the functional programming paradigm. In JavaScript, for instance, a lot of built-in functions like `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` return new arrays instead of modifying the original one. 

Here's an example in JavaScript:
```javascript
// OOP example - mutating an array
const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
myArray.push(4);
console.log(myArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Functional example - creating a new array
const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
const newArray = [...myArray, 4];
console.log(myArray); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(newArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

In the OOP example, we mutated the original array `myArray` by adding a new element to it. In the functional example, we created a new array `newArray` by spreading the elements of `myArray` and adding a new element. This way, we don't mutate the original array, and we can reuse the original array without worrying about changing its contents.

## Turn 6
Socratic Philosopher:
That's a great explanation! Now, let's move on to the second criterion: purity. Can you explain how purity is related to code reuse and how functional programming is better suited for it compared to OOP?

## Turn 7
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Sure thing!

A pure function is a function that has no side effects and always returns the same output given the same input. This is important for code reuse because it makes it easier to reason about the behavior of a function or component. With pure functions, you can be sure that the function or component will always behave the same way when given the same input.

Functional programming is better suited to purity than OOP is because purity is baked into the functional programming paradigm. In JavaScript, for instance, a lot of functional programming functions like `reduce`, `map`, and `filter` are pure functions.

Here's an example in JavaScript:
```javascript
// OOP example - impure function
let counter = 0;
function increment() {
 counter++;
 return counter;
}
console.log(increment()); // 1
console.log(increment()); // 2

// Functional example - pure function
function increment(counter) {
 return counter + 1;
}
let counter = 0;
counter = increment(counter);
console.log(counter); // 1
counter = increment(counter);
console.log(counter); // 2
```
In the OOP example, the `increment` function mutates the `counter` variable, which means that the function has side effects. This makes it difficult to reason about the behavior of the function, especially when it's used multiple times.

In the functional example, the `increment` function takes a `counter` parameter and returns a new value instead of mutating anything. This makes the function pure and easier to reason about. By passing the result to a new variable each time, we can keep track of the value of `counter`.

## Turn 8
Socratic Philosopher:
Excellent explanation! Now let's move on to the third criterion: higher-order functions. Can you explain how higher-order functions are related to code reuse and how functional programming is better suited for it compared to OOP?

## Turn 9
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Sure thing!

A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments and/or returns a function as its result. Higher-order functions are important for code reuse because they allow us to write more generic functions that can be reused in a variety of contexts.

Functional programming is better suited to higher-order functions than OOP is because it treats functions as first-class citizens. In JavaScript, for instance, functions can be passed around as values just like any other value.

Here's an example in JavaScript:
```javascript
// OOP example - not using higher-order functions
function add(a, b) {
 return a + b;
}

function multiply(a, b) {
 return a * b;
}

console.log(add(1, multiply(2, 3))); // 7

// Functional example - using higher-order functions
function add(a) {
 return function (b) {
 return a + b;
 }
}

function multiply(a) {
 return function (b) {
 return a * b;
 }
}

console.log(add(1)(multiply(2)(3))); // 7
```

In the OOP example, we have two separate functions that can only be used in specific contexts. In the functional example, we have two higher-order functions that return new functions based on their parameters. This allows us to write more generic functions that can be used in a variety of contexts.

## Turn 10
Socratic Philosopher:
That's a great explanation! Let's move on to the fourth criterion: composition. Can you explain how composition is related to code reuse and how functional programming is better suited for it compared to OOP?

## Turn 11
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Sure thing!

Composition refers to the ability to combine small, simple functions into larger, more complex functions. This is important for code reuse because it allows us to reuse small functions in a variety of contexts and create more complex and powerful functions.

Functional programming is better suited to composition than OOP is because it treats functions as first-class citizens and makes it easy to compose functions together. In JavaScript, for instance, we can use the `compose` function from the `ramda` library to compose functions together.

Here's an example in JavaScript:
```javascript
// OOP example - not using composition
function addOne(number) {
 return number + 1;
}

function double(number) {
 return number * 2;
}

console.log(double(addOne(3))); // 8

// Functional example - using composition
const addOne = (number) => number + 1;
const double = (number) => number * 2;

const compose = (f, g) => (x) => f(g(x));
const doubleThenAddOne = compose(addOne, double);

console.log(doubleThenAddOne(3)); // 7
```

In the OOP example, we have two separate functions that can only be used in specific contexts. In the functional example, we have two small, simple functions that can be composed together using the `compose` function. This allows us to create more complex functions, like `doubleThenAddOne`, that are still modular and reusable.

## Turn 12
Socratic Philosopher:
Great explanation! Let's move on to the fifth criterion: separation of concerns. Can you explain how separation of concerns is related to code reuse and how functional programming is better suited for it compared to OOP?

## Turn 13
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Sure!

Separation of concerns refers to the concept of breaking code down into small, modular pieces that each handle a specific concern or responsibility. This helps to create more modular and reusable code because it makes each piece of code more focused and easier to reason about.

Functional programming is better suited to separation of concerns than OOP is because it encourages the creation of small, pure, and composable functions that each handle a specific concern or responsibility. This makes it easier to write modular code that can be reused in a variety of contexts.

Here's an example in JavaScript:
```javascript
// OOP example - not using separation of concerns
class Order {
 constructor(items) {
 this.items = items;
 }
 calculateTotal() {
 let total = 0;
 for (let i = 0; i < this.items.length; i++) {
 total += this.items[i].price * this.items[i].quantity;
 }
 return total;
 }
}

// Functional example - using separation of concerns
const calculateTotal = (items) =>
 items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
```

In the OOP example, we have a single class `Order` that handles both storing the items and calculating the total. This makes it difficult to reuse the calculation code in other contexts.

In the functional example, we have a small, pure function `calculateTotal` that handles only the calculation of the total. This makes the function more modular and reusable, and it can be used in a variety of contexts with different item arrays.

## Turn 14
Socratic Philosopher:
Great explanation! Now let's move on to the sixth and final criterion: modularity. Can you explain how modularity is related to code reuse and how functional programming is better suited for it compared to OOP?

## Turn 15
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Sure thing!

Modularity refers to the concept of breaking code down into small, reusable modules. This is important for code reuse because it allows us to reuse code in a variety of contexts without having to rewrite the code each time.

Functional programming is better suited to modularity than OOP is because it encourages the creation of small, pure, and composable functions that can be combined together to create more complex and powerful modules.

Here's an example in JavaScript:
```javascript
// OOP example - not using modularity
class ShoppingCart {
 constructor() {
 this.items = [];
 }
 addItem(item) {
 this.items.push(item);
 }
 removeItem(item) {
 const index = this.items.indexOf(item);
 if (index > -1) {
 this.items.splice(index, 1);
 }
 }
 calculateTotal() {
 let total = 0;
 for (let i = 0; i < this.items.length; i++) {
 total += this.items[i].price * this.items[i].quantity;
 }
 return total;
 }
}

// Functional example - using modularity
const addItem = (item, items) => [...items, item];
const removeItem = (item, items) => items.filter((i) => i !== item);
const calculateTotal = (items) =>
 items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
```

In the OOP example, we have a single class `ShoppingCart` that handles both adding and removing items as well as calculating the total. This makes it difficult to reuse any of the functionality of the class in other contexts.

In the functional example, we have three small, pure functions `addItem`, `removeItem`, and `calculateTotal` that each handle a specific concern or responsibility. We can combine these functions together to create a more powerful and flexible shopping cart module. This makes it easier to reuse the code in a variety of contexts without having to rewrite the code each time.

## Turn 16
Socratic Philosopher:
Excellent explanation! You have covered all the criteria and explained how functional programming is better suited for code reuse compared to OOP. Is there anything else you would like to add to this discussion?

## Turn 17
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Just one more thing to add - while functional programming is better suited for code reuse in many cases, it's important to note that it's not always the best choice. There are certain situations where OOP might be a better fit, depending on the problem you're trying to solve. It's important to choose the right paradigm for the job at hand, and to always keep in mind the principles of modularity, composability, and separation of concerns when writing code.

## Turn 18
Socratic Philosopher:
Absolutely! You make a great point. Both paradigms have their strengths and weaknesses, and it's always important to choose the right tool for the job. Thanks for the great discussion!
