After a blowout loss to the Warriors in Game 2, the Lakers had to return the
favor.

Los Angeles cruised to a dominant 127-97 win over Golden State in Game 3 to
take a 2-1 series lead. It puts them in the driver's seat heading into another
home game on Monday night.

Anthony Davis led all scorers with 25 points while LeBron James finished with
21. But it was D'Angelo Russell who shouldered much of the offensive burden
for the Lakers, especially in the first half. He finished with 21 of his own
on 8 of 13 shooting.

The Warriors couldn't build on their confident performance last time out.
Despite holding a seven-point lead heading into the second quarter, they fell
apart after allowing the Lakers to close the first half on a 30-8 run. A weak
second half performance doomed their night, and they now need a win in Game 4
to avoid going down 3-1.

The Sporting News was tracking live scoring updates and highlights from Game 3
of Lakers vs. Warriors:

## Lakers vs. Warriors score

**Team** | **Q1** | **Q2** | **Q3** | **Q4** | **Final**

_(All times Eastern.)_

**11:15 p.m. FINAL  **— It's over. The Lakers bounce back from a big loss in
Game 2 by storming to a 127-97 win in Game 3. They now lead the series 2-1,
and they'll have a chance to make it 3-1 with another home game on Monday
night.

**11:05 p.m.  **— The Lakers just keep filling it up from downtown. Lonnie
Walker, Rui Hachimura and then Max Christie all drain triples to help make it
a 30-point Lakers lead. This is a beatdown.

**10:53 p.m.  **— Schroder buries a three and this game is all but over. The
Lakers hold a 26-point lead now with nine minutes remaining. What a
performance by LA tonight.  

**10:48 p.m.  **— Dennis Schroder tosses a beautiful lob to Davis, who throws
down the alley-oop in style. Things are spiraling out of control for Golden
State, and the deficit is now 24 points with ten minutes left.

**10:43 p.m. END OF THIRD QUARTER  **— The penultimate period ends with the
home team in full control up by 18 points. LA is 12 minutes away from taking a
2-1 series lead.

**10:39 p.m.  **— LeBron hits a fadeaway jumper, and the lead has now
ballooned to 20 points with the Lakers on top 86-66. James has rebounded from
his slow start, and he's racked up 21 points since going scoreless in the
first quarter.  

**10:34 p.m.  **— Fantastic hustle play by LeBron as he gallops down the court
to tip away a pass on a Warriors fast break. His momentum sent him flying into
the stands, and he gets a big round of applause as he trots back onto the
hardwood.

**10:30 p.m.  **— OH MY. Andrew Wiggins just threw down a vicious slam on AD!
That was an absolute hammer. The Lakers still lead by double-digits, but maybe
that'll help wake the Warriors up a little bit.

**10:24 p.m.  **— The Lakers are starting to build a decent cushion here.
Draymond picks up his fifth foul trying to stop AD from driving to the basket,
and he'll have to head to the bench. Davis makes both free throws and it's
71-55 Lakers.

**10:17 p.m.  **— LeBron buries a three, then Draymond Green gets called for
his fourth foul of the game on the other end. He's running a little hot, and
he needs to be careful here. He received a tech earlier in the game for
arguing with a referee. It hasn't been a great night for him so far, as he has
zero points and a -18 rating to go with his four fouls.

**10:13 p.m. START OF SECOND HALF  **— Two quarters left in this one. The
second half is underway.

**10:00 p.m.  **— The Lakers looked to be in trouble at one point in the first
half, but they roared back with a huge second quarter to take control of the
game. Let's see if they can keep it going in the second half.

**9:56 p.m. END OF FIRST HALF  **— What an end to the half for LA! Anthony
Davis beats the buzzer with a last-second layup to make it 59-48, and a 30-8
run in the second quarter has put the Lakers in the driver's seat!

**9:46 p.m.  **— Here come the Lakers! Russell is still red-hot, and he drains
a triple before shimmying past two defenders for a bucket to make it 51-42 LA!
That's a 22-2 run, and Russell is up to 21 points for the game.

**9:37 p.m.  **— The Lakers are back on top! LeBron hits a setback triple to
make it 42-40 in favor of the home team.

**9:34 p.m.  **— And now LeBron converts his first field goal of the night to
cut the Warriors' lead to three points! After a steal on the other end, Moses
Moody sticks his arm out and trips Anthony Davis. He's assessed with a
flagrant foul 1.

**9:28 p.m.  **— Anthony Davis hits two tough shots on consecutive
possessions, then James gets fouled on a fast break. He makes the first free
throw to finally get on the board. He now has a single point as the Warriors
lead 40-34.

**9:20 p.m.  **— Lonnie Walker checks in and hits a big three for the Lakers,
but Wiggins responds with a pair of buckets to stretch the lead to eight
points. LeBron James still hasn't scored a point or even taken a shot so far.
LA needs him to step up.

**9:14 p.m.  **— How's this for an unusual stat? LeBron James didn't even
attempt a shot in that quarter. Very strange, especially considering the
magnitude of this game. Russell, on the other hand, has attempted seven shots
and made five of them.

**9:12 p.m. END OF FIRST QUARTER  **— After trailing by as many as seven, the
Warriors storm back to take a seven-point lead at the end of the first
quarter. Thompson leads his team with 11 points on three of five shooting.

**9:06 p.m.  **— Klay Thompson uses a pick to get to his spot and knock down
his second three-pointer of the night. That gives the Warriors their first
lead of the game. Just moments later, he buries another one to extend Golden
State's lead to four points. He's heating up, which is bad news for Lakers
fans.

**8:59 p.m.  **— Andrew Wiggins rains in a three to close the gap to just two
points. The Lakers lead 19-17 heading into another timeout.

**8:53 p.m.  **— Russell has been absolutely on fire so far. He's already got
13 points on the night as the Lakers hold an early 17-12 lead at the first TV
timeout.

**8:48 p.m.  **— Anthony Davis goes for an emphatic slam but he's fouled by
Draymond Green. He went down hard and was briefly holding his head, but it
looks like he'll be alright. After a short review, the play is ruled a common
foul rather than a flagrant. That looks like the correct call.  

**8:44 p.m.  **— We are underway, and the Lakers are off to a fast start
thanks to D'Angelo Russell! D-Lo drains a trio of early three-pointers to make
it 9-2 Los Angeles.

**8:34 p.m.  **— It's about that time. Tip-off in Game 3 is just moments away.

**8:15 p.m.  **— LeBron James was out there putting work in early today. He
was spotted getting shots up a full five hours before game time in Crypto.com
Arena.

an hour. Draymond Green and JaMychal Green both start once again for the
Warriors.
