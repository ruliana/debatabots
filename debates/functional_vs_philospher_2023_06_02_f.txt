Can you elaborate on what you mean by "better"?

## Turn 3
Functional Programming Evangelist:

 Sure, here are some criteria I will use to compare the two paradigms when it comes to code reuse:
 1. Immutability
 2. Higher-Order Functions
 3. Composition
 4. Purity
 5. Separation of Concerns
 6. Modularity
 7. Domain-Specific Languages
 8. Type Inference
 Let's go through each of these points in turn and compare how functional programming is better suited for code reuse than OOP.
 

## Turn 4
Socratic Philosopher:
Great, let's start with the first criterion: immutability. Can you explain how immutability makes functional programming better for code reuse than OOP?

## Turn 5
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Immutability is the property of not being able to change an object after it has been created. Here are some ways in which immutability makes functional programming better for code reuse than OOP: 

1. Immutability makes it easier to reason about the code. With immutable objects, you can be sure that once you have passed an object into a function, it will not change. This reduces the complexity of the code, which makes it easier to understand, debug, and modify. In contrast, with mutable objects in OOP, it can be hard to keep track of where the object has been modified, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

2. Immutability encourages reuse by making it easier to create new objects. In functional programming, it is common to define new objects by applying a function to existing objects. Since the input objects are immutable, you can be sure that applying the function will always produce the same output. This makes it easier to create new objects with predictable behavior, which in turn makes it easier to reuse code.

Here's an example in Python to illustrate this point. Let's say we have a list of numbers, and we want to create a new list that contains only the even numbers. Here's how we could do that using Python's built-in filter function:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)
```

In this example, we're using the filter function to create a new list of even numbers. The filter function takes a function and an iterable, and returns a new iterable that contains only the elements for which the function returns True. Because we're using an immutable iterable (a list), we can be sure that the filter function will always produce the same output. This makes it easy to reuse this code in other parts of our program.

## Turn 6
Socratic Philosopher:
Thank you for explaining how immutability makes functional programming better for code reuse. How about the second criterion: higher-order functions? Can you explain how higher-order functions make functional programming better for code reuse than OOP?

## Turn 7
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Higher-order functions are functions that take one or more functions as arguments, or that return a function as their result. Here are some ways in which higher-order functions make functional programming better for code reuse than OOP:

1. Higher-order functions enable code reuse by allowing code to be abstracted over functions. Since higher-order functions take functions as arguments, they can be used to separate the code that performs some operation from the specifics of that operation. This separation enables the same code to be used with different functions, which in turn makes it easier to reuse code.

2. Higher-order functions enable code reuse by allowing code to be composed from smaller functions. Since higher-order functions can return functions as their result, they can be used to combine smaller functions into larger ones. This composability enables the creation of complex functions from simpler ones, which in turn makes it easier to reuse code.

Here's an example in Python to illustrate this point. Let's say we have a list of numbers, and we want to apply a function to each element of the list. Here's how we could do that using Python's built-in map function:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)
```

In this example, we're using the map function to apply the lambda function to each element of the list. The map function takes a function and an iterable, and returns a new iterable that contains the result of applying the function to each element of the iterable. Because the map function is a higher-order function, we can reuse the same code with different functions. For example, we could apply a different function to the same list of numbers:

```python
negated_numbers = map(lambda x: -x, numbers)
```

In this case, we're using the map function to apply the lambda function that negates its argument to each element of the list. The result is a new iterable that contains the negated numbers.

## Turn 8
Socratic Philosopher:
Thank you for explaining how higher-order functions make functional programming better for code reuse. How about the third criterion: composition? Can you explain how composition makes functional programming better for code reuse than OOP?

## Turn 9
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Composition is the act of combining simple functions to form more complex ones. Here are some ways in which composition makes functional programming better for code reuse than OOP:

1. Composition enables the creation of reusable, modular code. Since functions in functional programming are composable, you can define small, simple functions that can be easily combined to form more complex ones. This makes it easier to create reusable, modular code that can be used in different parts of your program.

2. Composition makes it easier to reason about code. Since functions in functional programming are composable, you can break down complex code into smaller, more manageable functions. This makes it easier to reason about the code, as it's easier to understand small, simple functions than large, complex ones.

Here's an example in Python to illustrate this point. Let's say we have a list of numbers, and we want to create a new list that contains only the even numbers, and then we want to square each of those even numbers. Here's how we could do that using functional programming:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)
squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x**2, even_numbers)
```

In this example, we're using the filter function to create a new list of even numbers, and then we're using the map function to square each of those even numbers. By breaking down the problem into smaller, composable functions, we're able to create a reusable, modular solution. We could reuse the same code to create a new list of odd numbers that are squared by simply changing the filter function:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
odd_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 != 0, numbers)
squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x**2, odd_numbers)
```

In this case, we're using the filter function to create a new list of odd numbers, and then we're using the map function to square each of those odd numbers. The result is a new iterable that contains the squared odd numbers.

## Turn 10
Socratic Philosopher:
Thank you for elaborating on how composition makes functional programming better for code reuse. How about the fourth criterion: purity? Can you explain how purity makes functional programming better for code reuse than OOP?

## Turn 11
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Purity is a property of functions that have no side effects and always return the same output given the same input. In functional programming, pure functions are preferred because they are easier to reason about and test. Here are some ways in which purity makes functional programming better for code reuse than OOP:

1. Purity makes it easier to reason about code. Since pure functions have no side effects and always return the same output given the same input, they are easier to reason about and test. This makes it easier to understand how a piece of code works, which in turn makes it easier to reuse that code in other parts of your program.

2. Purity enables referential transparency. Referential transparency is the property of being able to replace a function call with its result without changing the behavior of the program. This property enables code to be reused more easily, as it means that any function call can be replaced with its result, making the code easier to understand and modify.

Here's an example in Python to illustrate this point. Let's say we have a simple pure function that adds two numbers:

```python
def add(a, b):
 return a + b
```

In this example, the add function is pure because it has no side effects and always returns the same output given the same input. This makes it easy to reason about and test. We could reuse this function in different parts of our program without worrying about side effects or unexpected behavior.

```python
result1 = add(2, 3) # returns 5
result2 = add(10, 20) # returns 30
```

In this case, we're using the add function to add two numbers together. We can be sure that the function will always return the same output given the same input, which makes it easy to reason about and test.

## Turn 12
Socratic Philosopher:
Thank you for explaining how purity makes functional programming better for code reuse. How about the fifth criterion: separation of concerns? Can you explain how separation of concerns makes functional programming better for code reuse than OOP?

## Turn 13
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Separation of concerns is the act of separating code into distinct sections, each of which has a specific responsibility. Here are some ways in which separation of concerns makes functional programming better for code reuse than OOP:

1. Separation of concerns enables the creation of modular, reusable code. By separating code into distinct sections, each of which has a specific responsibility, you can create code that is modular and reusable. This makes it easier to reuse the code in different parts of your program, as you can reuse individual sections of code without having to worry about other parts of the program.

2. Separation of concerns makes it easier to understand and modify code. By separating code into distinct sections, each of which has a specific responsibility, you can create code that is easier to understand and modify. This is because each section of the code is responsible for a specific task, making it easier to understand what that section of the code is doing.

Here's an example in Python to illustrate this point. Let's say we have a program that reads data from a file, processes the data, and writes the processed data to a new file. We could separate this code into three distinct sections: one that reads the data from the file, one that processes the data, and one that writes the processed data to a new file:

```python
def read_data(filename):
 # code to read data from file goes here

def process_data(data):
 # code to process data goes here

def write_data(filename, data):
 # code to write data to file goes here

# main program logic
data = read_data("input.txt")
processed_data = process_data(data)
write_data("output.txt", processed_data)
```

In this example, we've separated the code into three distinct sections, each of which has a specific responsibility. This makes the code modular and reusable, as we can reuse each section of the code in different parts of our program. It also makes the code easier to understand and modify, as each section of the code is responsible for a specific task.
