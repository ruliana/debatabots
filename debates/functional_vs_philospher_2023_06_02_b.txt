Functional Programming Evangelist:
Functional Programming is better than OOP for code reuse.

## Turn 2
Socratic Philosopher:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "better"?

## Turn 3
Functional Programming Evangelist:

 Sure, here are some criteria I will use to compare the two paradigms when it comes to code reuse:
 1. Immutability
 2. Higher-Order Functions
 3. Composition
 4. Purity
 5. Separation of Concerns
 6. Modularity
 7. Domain-Specific Languages
 8. Type Inference
 Let's go through each of these points in turn and compare how functional programming is better suited for code reuse than OOP.
 

## Turn 4
Socratic Philosopher:
Great, let's start with the first criterion: immutability. Can you explain why you believe immutability is important for code reuse?

## Turn 5
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Certainly! Immutability is important for code reuse because it makes code more predictable and easier to reason about. When you modify an object's state in OOP, you can never be sure what other parts of the program might be affected by that change. This can lead to unexpected bugs and make it difficult to maintain the code over time. In contrast, in functional programming, data is treated as immutable, which means that modifying a value creates a new value without changing the original. This makes it easier to reason about the effects of code and makes it less likely that bugs will be introduced during maintenance. 

For example, let's say we have a list of integers that we want to sort using the sort() function. In OOP, we might modify the state of the original list to sort it in place:
```python
my_list.sort()
```
While this works, it means that the original list is no longer in its original order, which might cause problems elsewhere in the code. In functional programming, we would instead create a new sorted list without modifying the original:
```python
sorted_list = sorted(my_list)
```
This means that the original list remains unchanged and we can be sure that no other parts of the program will be affected by the sorting operation.

## Turn 6
Socratic Philosopher:
Thank you for explaining the importance of immutability in functional programming. How does immutability lead to more code reuse, specifically?

## Turn 7
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Immutability leads to more code reuse in functional programming because it allows us to write pure functions that operate solely on their inputs, without any side effects. By not relying on mutable state, we can reuse these pure functions in a wide variety of contexts without worrying about how they interact with other parts of the program.

For instance, let's say we have a pure function that squares a number:
```python
def square(x):
 return x * x
```
This function is completely stateless and has no side effects - it simply takes an input and produces an output. We can then reuse this function in a wide variety of contexts without worrying about how it will interact with other parts of the program. For example, we might use it in a map operation to square every element of a list:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_list = list(map(square, my_list))
```
This produces a new list containing the squares of all the elements in the original list, without modifying the original. Because the square function is pure and has no side effects, we can reuse it in other contexts as well without worrying about how it will interact with other parts of the program. This makes it easier to write modular, reusable code.

## Turn 8
Socratic Philosopher:
That's a good point. Moving on to the next criterion, higher-order functions: can you elaborate on why you believe higher-order functions are important for code reuse?

## Turn 9
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Of course! Higher-order functions are important for code reuse because they allow us to write generic, reusable code that can operate on a wide variety of inputs without modification.

In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, which means that they can be passed as arguments to other functions and returned as values from functions. This allows us to create higher-order functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as values. These higher-order functions can then be used to create generic, reusable code that can operate on a wide variety of inputs.

For instance, let's say we have a higher-order function that takes a function f and applies it to every element of a list:
```python
def apply_to_all(f, lst):
 return [f(x) for x in lst]
```
This function is completely generic and can be used to apply any function to any list of inputs. For example, we might use it to square every element of a list:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_list = apply_to_all(square, my_list)
```
This returns a new list containing the squares of all the elements in the original list, without modifying the original. Because the apply_to_all function is higher-order and takes a function f as an argument, we can reuse it with any function, not just the square function. 

This makes it easier to write generic, reusable code that can be used in a wide variety of contexts. With higher-order functions, we can write a function once and reuse it in many different ways without having to modify it.

## Turn 10
Socratic Philosopher:
That's a great explanation of how higher-order functions can lead to more code reuse. Moving on to the next criterion, composition: Can you explain why you believe composition is important for code reuse in functional programming?

## Turn 11
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Certainly! Composition is important for code reuse in functional programming because it allows us to build complex, reusable functions from simple, composable functions.

In functional programming, functions are designed to be small, simple, and composable. Rather than writing large, monolithic functions that do many things, we write small, focused functions that do one thing well. We can then combine these functions to create more complex functions using function composition. 

Function composition allows us to take two or more functions and combine them to create a new function that performs both operations. For example, let's say we have two functions that add 1 to a number and then square it:
```python
def add_one(x):
 return x + 1

def square(x):
 return x * x
```
We can then compose these functions to create a new function that adds 1 to a number and then squares it:
```python
add_one_and_square = compose(square, add_one)
```
This new function takes a number, adds 1 to it, and then squares it. By composing simple functions in this way, we can create complex, reusable functions that can be used in a wide variety of contexts.

For instance, we might use this composed function in a map operation to add 1 to every element of a list and then square it:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
new_list = list(map(add_one_and_square, my_list))
```
This returns a new list containing the squares of all the elements in the original list, after adding 1 to each. In this way, we can use composition to create complex, reusable functions from simple, composable functions.
