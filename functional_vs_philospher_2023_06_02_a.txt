## Turn 2
Socratic Philosopher:
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "better"?

## Turn 3
Functional Programming Evangelist:

 Sure, here are some criteria I will use to compare the two paradigms when it comes to code reuse:
 1. Immutability
 2. Higher-Order Functions
 3. Composition
 4. Purity
 5. Separation of Concerns
 6. Modularity
 7. Domain-Specific Languages
 8. Type Inference
 Let's go through each of these points in turn and compare how functional programming is better suited for code reuse than OOP.
 

## Turn 4
Socratic Philosopher:
Great, let's start with the first criteria: immutability. How does immutability in functional programming make it better for code reuse compared to OOP?

## Turn 5
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Immutability is an important feature of functional programming languages. It means that once a value is defined, it cannot be changed. Here's how it makes functional programming better for code reuse:
 
1. Immutability makes code easier to reason about because it eliminates side-effects. This makes it easier to test and debug programs. In OOP, mutable objects can have unexpected changes in state that affect other parts of the program, leading to hard-to-find bugs.

2. Immutability makes it easier to create pure functions. A pure function is one that has no side-effects and always returns the same output for the same input. Pure functions are more reusable because they can be used in any context without changing the program's state. 

3. In OOP, there's a tendency to use mutable objects to share state between objects. This can make it harder to reason about the program and more difficult to reuse code. In functional programming, immutable data structures can be used to share state without worrying about side effects. 

Example:
Consider a web application that has several components that need to access some data. In OOP, a shared mutable state object might be used to store the data, which could cause issues with concurrency. In functional programming, immutable data structures can be used to store the data, which makes it easier to reason about and reuse because there are no side effects.

## Turn 6
Socratic Philosopher:
Interesting points. Can you clarify how immutable data structures make it easier to share state in functional programming?

## Turn 7
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Certainly! In functional programming, data structures are immutable by default. This means that once a value is created, it cannot be changed. Instead of modifying an existing data structure, functional programming techniques create new data structures that represent the updated state.

Consider a simple example where we need to modify a list of numbers:

```python
# OOP
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list) # [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Functional
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
new_list = my_list + [4]
print(my_list) # [1, 2, 3]
print(new_list) # [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

In the OOP example, we modified the existing list by appending a value to it. In the functional example, we created a new list that includes the original values and the new value. This means that all the original values remain unchanged, which reduces the potential for side effects and makes it easier to reason about the program.

In functional programming, immutable data structures can be shared between functions without worrying about them being modified in an unexpected way. This makes it easier to write reusable code that can safely operate on shared data structures.

## Turn 8
Socratic Philosopher:
Interesting. Can you now explain how higher-order functions and composition in functional programming make it better for code reuse compared to OOP?

## Turn 9
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Sure! Here's how higher-order functions and composition can make functional programming better for code reuse compared to OOP:

1. Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions. They allow for the creation of more generic and reusable code. In functional programming, higher-order functions are commonly used to abstract away common patterns of behavior that can be reused across the application.

2. Composition is the idea of taking simple functions and combining them to form more complex functions. This is done using higher-order functions. Composition makes it easy to reuse existing functions to create new ones that fulfill a specific requirement. In functional programming, functions are designed to be small and focused, which makes them easy to compose to create more complex functionality.

3. In OOP, code reuse is often achieved through inheritance. This can lead to complex and inflexible code if not done carefully. In contrast, higher-order functions and composition in functional programming allow for more flexible and reusable code because they allow for the creation of small, focused functions that can be combined in various ways to create complex behavior. 

Example:
Consider a web application that needs to filter a list of products based on a specific criterion, say, "only show products that are in stock and cost less than $50". In OOP, you might create a new class that inherits from the product class and adds a new method for filtering based on the criterion. This results in a more complex codebase.

In functional programming, you could define a function `filterProducts` that takes a list of products and a filtering function as arguments. The filtering function would take a single product and return a Boolean value indicating whether the product satisfies the filtering criterion. You could then create a new filtering function that checks whether a product is in stock and costs less than $50 and use it in the `filterProducts` function. This would result in a much simpler and more reusable implementation.

## Turn 10
Socratic Philosopher:
Great explanation. Can you explain how purity in functional programming makes it better for code reuse compared to OOP?
