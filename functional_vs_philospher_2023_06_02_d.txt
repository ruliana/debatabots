 Sure, here are some criteria I will use to compare the two paradigms when it comes to code reuse:
 1. Immutability
 2. Higher-Order Functions
 3. Composition
 4. Purity
 5. Separation of Concerns
 6. Modularity
 7. Domain-Specific Languages
 8. Type Inference
 Let's go through each of these points in turn and compare how functional programming is better suited for code reuse than OOP.
 

## Turn 4
Socratic Philosopher:
Sounds good. Can you explain what you mean by "code reuse" in this context?

## Turn 5
Functional Programming Evangelist:
By code reuse I mean the ability to write code that can be easily adapted to different use cases. This can be achieved through modularity, abstraction and separation of concerns, which allow us to write code that can be easily combined and composed to solve a variety of problems. In other words, we want to write code that is flexible, adaptable and modular, so that it can be reused in different contexts without having to rewrite everything from scratch.

## Turn 6
Socratic Philosopher:
Great, thanks for the clarification. Now let's go through the points you've highlighted and compare how functional programming and OOP address each one when it comes to code reuse.

2. Higher-Order Functions: How do higher-order functions help with code reuse, and how are they better supported in functional programming compared to OOP? 
3. Composition: How does composition help with code reuse, and how is it better supported in functional programming compared to OOP? 
4. Purity: How does purity help with code reuse, and how is it better supported in functional programming compared to OOP?
5. Separation of Concerns: How does separation of concerns help with code reuse, and how is it better supported in functional programming compared to OOP?
6. Modularity: How does modularity help with code reuse, and how is it better supported in functional programming compared to OOP?

8. Type Inference: How does type inference help with code reuse, and how is it better supported in functional programming compared to OOP?

## Turn 7
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Sure, here are my thoughts on each point:

1. Immutability: In functional programming, immutability is a core principle, which means that once a data structure is created, it cannot be modified. This promotes code reuse by ensuring that functions and data structures have no side effects and are therefore independent of their context. This allows functions to be reused in different contexts without affecting the original data. In comparison, OOP tends to promote mutability, which can lead to unexpected side effects and make the code harder to reason about.

Example in Python:
```python
# functional programming style
def add_one(numbers):
 return list(map(lambda x: x+1, numbers))

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
new_numbers = add_one(numbers)
print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3]
print(new_numbers) # [2, 3, 4]

# OOP style
class Numbers:
 def __init__(self, numbers):
 self.numbers = numbers
 
 def add_one(self):
 for i in range(len(self.numbers)):
 self.numbers[i] = self.numbers[i] + 1

numbers = Numbers([1, 2, 3])
numbers.add_one()
print(numbers.numbers) # [2, 3, 4]
```

2. Higher-Order Functions: Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as parameters or return functions as their result. This allows for more generic and reusable code, as functions can be composed and combined in various ways to solve different problems. Functional programming is particularly well-suited for higher-order functions, as functions are treated as first-class citizens and can be passed around like any other value. In comparison, OOP typically relies on inheritance and method overriding for code reuse, which can lead to complex hierarchies and tight coupling between classes.

Example in Python:
```python
# functional programming style
def apply_operation(numbers, operation):
 return list(map(operation, numbers))

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
addition = lambda x: x + 1
multiplication = lambda x: x * 2
new_numbers1 = apply_operation(numbers, addition)
new_numbers2 = apply_operation(numbers, multiplication)
print(new_numbers1) # [2, 3, 4]
print(new_numbers2) # [2, 4, 6]

# OOP style
class Numbers:
 def __init__(self, numbers):
 self.numbers = numbers
 
 def apply_operation(self, operation):
 new_numbers = []
 for number in self.numbers:
 new_numbers.append(operation(number))
 return new_numbers
 
numbers = Numbers([1, 2, 3])
addition = lambda x: x + 1
multiplication = lambda x: x * 2
new_numbers1 = numbers.apply_operation(addition)
new_numbers2 = numbers.apply_operation(multiplication)
print(new_numbers1) # [2, 3, 4]
print(new_numbers2) # [2, 4, 6]
```

3. Composition: Composition is the process of combining two or more functions to create a new function. This allows for more modular and reusable code, as functions can be created by composing simpler functions. Functional programming is particularly well-suited for composition, as functions can be easily combined using function composition operators. In comparison, OOP typically relies on inheritance and method overriding for code reuse, which can lead to complex hierarchies and tight coupling between classes.

Example in Python:
```python
# functional programming style
def add_one(number):
 return number + 1

def multiply_by_two(number):
 return number * 2

new_function = lambda x: multiply_by_two(add_one(x))
result = new_function(3)
print(result) # 8

# OOP style
class AddOne:
 def __call__(self, number):
 return number + 1

class MultiplyByTwo:
 def __call__(self, number):
 return number * 2

class NewFunction:
 def __init__(self):
 self.add_one = AddOne()
 self.multiply_by_two = MultiplyByTwo()
 
 def __call__(self, number):
 return self.multiply_by_two(self.add_one(number))

new_function = NewFunction()
result = new_function(3)
print(result) # 8
```

4. Purity: Pure functions are functions that do not have side effects and always return the same output given the same input. This promotes code reuse by ensuring that functions are independent of their context and can be safely reused in different contexts without affecting the original data. Functional programming is particularly well-suited for pure functions, as immutability and higher-order functions make it easy to write and compose pure functions. In comparison, OOP tends to promote side effects and mutable state, which can make it harder to reason about code and reuse functions in different contexts.

Example in Python:
```python
# functional programming style
def add_two_numbers(a, b):
 return a + b

result1 = add_two_numbers(2, 3) # result is always 5

# OOP style
class Numbers:
 def __init__(self, numbers):
 self.numbers = numbers
 
 def add(self, number):
 self.numbers.append(number)
 
 def get_sum(self):
 return sum(self.numbers)

numbers = Numbers([1, 2, 3])
numbers.add(4)
result2 = numbers.get_sum() # result depends on the state of the object
```

5. Separation of Concerns: Separation of concerns is the process of breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable parts. This allows for more modular and reusable code, as different parts of the program can be developed and tested independently of each other. Functional programming is particularly well-suited for separation of concerns, as functions are independent entities that can be easily combined and composed to solve different problems. In comparison, OOP can lead to tight coupling between classes and a complex hierarchy of inheritance that can make it harder to separate concerns and reuse code.

Example in Python:
```python
# functional programming style
def filter_numbers(numbers, condition):
 return list(filter(condition, numbers))

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
odd_numbers = filter_numbers(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 != 0)

# OOP style
class Numbers:
 def __init__(self, numbers):
 self.numbers = numbers
 
 def filter(self, condition):
 return list(filter(condition, self.numbers))

numbers = Numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
even_numbers = numbers.filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
odd_numbers = numbers.filter(lambda x: x % 2 != 0)
```

6. Modularity: Modularity is the process of breaking down a program into smaller, more manageable modules. This allows for more reusable and maintainable code, as different modules can be developed and tested independently of each other. Functional programming is particularly well-suited for modularity, as functions are independent entities that can be easily combined and composed to solve different problems. In comparison, OOP can lead to complex hierarchies of inheritance that can make it harder to modularize code and reuse functions in different contexts.

Example in Python:
```python
# functional programming style
from math import sqrt

def distance(p1, p2):
 x1, y1 = p1
 x2, y2 = p2
 return sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)

# OOP style
class Point:
 def __init__(self, x, y):
 self.x = x
 self.y = y
 
 def distance_to(self, other_point):
 x1, y1 = self.x, self.y
 x2, y2 = other_point.x, other_point.y
 return sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)

point1 = Point(1, 2)
point2 = Point(3, 4)
distance = point1.distance_to(point2)
```

7. Domain-Specific Languages: Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are languages that are specialized to a particular domain or problem space. This allows for more expressive and concise code, as the language is tailored to the needs of the problem at hand. Functional programming is particularly well-suited for DSLs, as higher-order functions and function composition operators make it easy to create domain-specific abstractions. In comparison, OOP tends to rely on inheritance and method overriding for abstraction, which can lead to a complex hierarchy of classes that can be hard to understand and maintain.

Example in Python:
```python
# functional programming style
def query_data(data, query):
 return query(data)

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
query1 = lambda data: list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, data))
query2 = lambda data: list(map(lambda x: x * 2, data))
result1 = query_data(data, query1) # [2, 4]
result2 = query_data(data, query2) # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# OOP style
class Data:
 def __init__(self, data):
 self.data = data
 
 def filter(self, condition):
 return list(filter(condition, self.data))
 
 def map(self, function):
 return list(map(function, self.data))

data = Data([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
result1 = data.filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
result2 = data.map(lambda x: x * 2)
```

8. Type Inference: Type inference is the process of automatically determining the type of a variable or expression. This allows for more concise and readable code, as the programmer does not need to specify types explicitly. Functional programming is particularly well-suited for type inference, as immutable data structures and higher-order functions make it easy to reason about types and infer them automatically. In comparison, OOP tends to rely on explicit type declarations and static type checking, which can make the code harder to read and maintain.

Example in Python:
```python
# functional programming style
def add_one(number: int) -> int:
 return number + 1

result = add_one(3) # result is int

# OOP style
class Numbers:
 def __init__(self, numbers: List[int]):
 self.numbers = numbers
 
 def add(self, number: int) -> None:
 self.numbers.append(number)
 
 def get_sum(self) -> int:
 return sum(self.numbers)

numbers = Numbers([1, 2, 3])
numbers.add(4)
result = numbers.get_sum() # result is int
```

## Turn 8
Socratic Philosopher:
Thanks for the detailed explanations. It seems that you have made a compelling case for the superiority of functional programming over OOP in terms of code reuse, particularly when it comes to immutability, higher-order functions, composition, purity, separation of concerns, modularity, domain-specific languages, and type inference. 

However, I would like to challenge you to consider some alternative viewpoints on the matter. For example, some OOP Evangelists might argue that OOP is better suited for code reuse because of concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which allow for more flexible and extensible code. They might also argue that functional programming can be harder to understand and maintain, especially for developers who are used to OOP. What would you say to those arguments?

## Turn 9
Functional Programming Evangelist:
Those are valid points, and it's true that OOP has some features that can be useful for code reuse, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. However, I would argue that functional programming is still better suited for code reuse overall because it promotes more modular and composable code, which makes it easier to reason about and reuse functions in different contexts. 

As for the argument that functional programming can be harder to understand and maintain, I would say that this is a matter of personal preference and experience. While it's true that functional programming can take some time to get used to, once you become familiar with its concepts and patterns, it can actually be easier to reason about and maintain than OOP. 

Furthermore, it's worth noting that many popular programming languages, such as Python and JavaScript, support both functional programming and OOP, so developers can choose the approach that is best suited for their particular problem. Ultimately, the choice between functional programming and OOP should be based on the specific needs of the project and the preferences and experience of the development team.

## Turn 10
